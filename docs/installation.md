# Installation

I recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast dependency management:


## Install from GitHub

To install the latest version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/SaarShafir/audio_signal.git
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/SaarShafir/audio_signal.git
```
